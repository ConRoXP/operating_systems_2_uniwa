# Operating Systems II - CSE UniWA Course 2024-2025 

The syllabus of the course is as follows:

• **Multiprocessor and Multicomputer Operating Systems** (special requirements and operating system design issues for multiprocessor environments, process communication and synchronization methods, process scheduling algorithms, memory schemes and memory management methods, load distribution across multiple processors, etc.).  
• **Advanced concepts of process communication-synchronization** (theory of deadlock prevention and avoidance, inter-process communication through pipes and sockets, etc.).  
• **Thread Management in multiprocessing environments** (special requirements and scheduling algorithms, special requirements and synchronization-communication mechanisms, etc.).  
• **Real-Time Operating Systems** (basic concepts and design issues, special algorithms for CPU scheduling, memory organization-management and disk scheduling, application in embedded systems and multimedia systems, etc.).  
• **Special requirements of operating systems of mobile devices and environments with limited resources** (sensor networks, etc.).  
• **Virtual machines - virtualization** (definitions, categorization, virtualization techniques, the concept of hypervisor and supported types, etc.).  
• **Network and distributed resource operating systems** (definitions, categorization, design issues, services, etc.).  

**Lab**:
Unix/Linux: System programming and concurrent processes (child processes, use of fork,
wait, exec, signals/traps, etc.). Special mechanisms to support communication and process
synchronization (shared memory segments, semaphores, message queues, etc.).
Programming and thread management using the Posix threads library. Interprocess
communication and programming using pipes and sockets.

# Assignment 1
Programming in C: child processes and the fork() function.

# Assignment 2
Programming in C: POSIX threads and inter-process communication and synchronization.
